The UAH data set contains information on temperatures of various regions in the years of 1978-2023.


The plot shows the average temperature in each region each year based on the selected month.
The widgets on the Plot tab allow users to select different month`s data to view, and users are able to change
the color of the points on the graph. When selecting a month, there is a text output that tells the user which
months they have selected.

The table shows the temperature of a region on a given month and year. The year values from the data set
are filtered. The widget on the side allows users to select the range of years they want to use.
The text output below the widget tells the user which years they are viewing.
